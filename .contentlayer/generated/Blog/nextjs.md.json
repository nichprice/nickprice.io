Let’s break this down.\n\n## React, a JavaScript Library\n\nFirstly, we know that a JavaScript library is pre-written code that allows for easier development of JavaScript. You can think of a library as a repository of functions that are hidden beneath the surface.\n\nLet’s say that when building JavaScript web apps, you frequently found yourself writing three functions: x, y, and z. You also frequently found yourself later calling those three functions at the same time.\n\nWouldn’t it be nice if you simply had one built in function that did this for you? A function you never even had to declare in the first place? This is where libraries come in. They provide you with built in functions that are commonly used. In the context of our x, y, z example, the library would have a built in function, A, consisting of all the of parts of x, y, and z, and calls them all at the same time.\n\nTLDR; libraries are powerful tools that help you more quickly and efficiently write build apps.\n\n## Next.js, a React Framework\n\nThink broadly, what is a frame work? We can think of frameworks in regard to the building of a house. The frame and foundation always go up early in the building process and are then built around and on top of.\n\nWeb frameworks are very similar. They provide the scaffolding or a blueprint, for an app to be built on top of. They essentially provide you rules that you have to abide by in order not to break anything but they also provide built in functionality that makes it very easy to incorporate other pieces of tech.\n\nAn example would be data analytics. Would you rather build your own data analytics program from scratch, or would you prefer to simple install a few packages into your app and use a third party data analytics program built by a company who specializes on the subject?\n\nThere are arguments to be made for both, but for the most part, if you’re crunched for time or uninterested in learning about building a data analytics platform, a using a web framework that can easily integrate third party tech is very appealing.\n\n## Full Circle\n\n_Next.js is a React framework._\n\nApplying our knowledge of the power of libraries and frameworks, it it intuitively clear that a framework built to work with a library can be an incredibly powerful tool for developers.\n\nNext.js takes a lot of the guesswork out of building. By abiding by Next.js conventions, we can have a fairly advanced app up and running at a rate that developers previously would’ve never thought possible (just kidding, they knew it was only a matter of time).\n",
